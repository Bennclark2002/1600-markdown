# More about me!
Im from right outside of Kansas City about 20 minutes or so east of it and have grown up being a big KC sports fan

I love the Chiefs, always have especailly when they were not that good of a team (before the goat himself Patrick Mahomes).

One of my biggest interests that i have always had ever since i was a kid was cars and planes. i grew up around my grandpas and my dad who were big car guys and i think thats why its been the biggest influence on me to be one. When i was 16 and i got my car i was in my own new world and from there ive always wanted to do something realted to the automotive industry!
